# Optimisation-carsharing
Optimised location, timings, and amount of vehicles to move, accounting for labour costs â€“ this is because vehicles 
have to be moved between different charging points due to a difference in demand and varying popularity of pick-up/return points. 
Trips were simulated & discrete optimisation was applied
